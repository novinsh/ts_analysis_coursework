# Time Series Analysis Course Project
The goal of the project was to apply ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX and holt-winter family of models on two different time series. At the end, the forecast performance of each fitted models studied and reported using the conventional error measures. Appropriateness of the models mainly studied by studying the residuals. Required preprocessing steps addressing stationarity of the series applied where needed.
